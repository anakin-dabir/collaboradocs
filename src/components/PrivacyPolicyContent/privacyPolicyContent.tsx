            communications and advertisements for our products and services so
            that they are more relevant to you.

            is pseudonymised to protect your personal data.
          </Typography>
          <Typography pl={3}>
            • Analyzing and continually improving the platform and the Services
            and helping us pilot test versions of the platform internally to

            access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal
            data be updated, corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also

            concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able
            to resolve, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with the
            relevant data protection supervisory authority where you reside. As
            noted above, even where such rights apply, they are subject to
            limits. This means that, in certain circumstances, we may not be
            required or able to meet your request, or we may only meet your
            request in part.

            7. TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            We operate internationally and as a consequence thereof we will,
            when providing the Services to you transfer the information we
            collect about you across international borders, including from the
            EEA and other countries, for processing and storage. The transfer,
            storage or accessing of your information by us and our service
            providers may involve jurisdictions that may not provide levels of
            data protection equivalent to your home jurisdiction. Where we
            transfer personal data from the EEA to countries outside of the EEA
            which are not recognized as providing adequate data protection, we
            provide appropriate safeguards in the form of intercompany
            agreements or agreements with services providers for the transfer of
            data, based on the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under EU
            law. For further information, please contact us at Legal@ark.trade.

          <Typography>
            We protect your personal information by using data security
            technology and using tools such as firewalls and data encryption. We
            also require that you use a personal username and password every

            ARK’s terms and conditions, terms of business and/or terms of use,
            you must not share your password with anyone else. We recommend that
            you do not re-use a password previously used by you for other
            platforms/services. We restrict access to personal information at
            our offices so that only officers and/or employees with a legitimate
            business purpose can access it.
